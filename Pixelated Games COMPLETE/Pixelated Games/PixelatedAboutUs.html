		<h1><center>About Us</center></h1>
		<p>Pixels were developed by a group of aspiring students to stand in the center of computer technology. Not every business meets success, like any other companies out there, Pixels was full of up and downs. The reason it reached its glory today is because all of the hard work that they did to make it possible.</p> 
		<p>The developers of Pixels started way back during their college days, they started as a group project formed by 5-man team members and after finishing college they got back together again and formed up a real team to form a company which is called Pixels. Their first work initiated during 2018, at first things werent going well, and they were incurring losses from their capital and perhaps they were also barely meeting ends meet but that didnt stop them and they tried switching their focus to developing more games like they did during their college days, their games a was a hit. Their games were composed of old retro games and it gathered the attention of a lot of adult male fans in their 30s, but thats not the end of it. </p>
		<p>They still made a lot of games from educational games to rated adult games and succeeded. They now have an outstanding millions of fans from all over the world expecting for more games they would procure.</p>
